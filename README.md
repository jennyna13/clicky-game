<h1>Clicky Game</h1>

<p>React Application</p>

<ol>
<li>The application should render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image should listen for click events.</li>

<li>The application should keep track of the user's score. The user's score should be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score should be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.</li>

<li>Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page should shuffle themselves in a random order.
Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game should restart.</li>

<li>When complete, the application should be deployed to Github Pages. See the README generated with Create React App for instructions on deploying the application to Github Pages.</li>
